## About

This is a Python workshop for the *Festival Latinoamericano de Instalación de Software Libre 2017* for which I was invited. It is basically about some Python basics, focused on image manipulation.

I don't use any lib other than `NumPy` and `Matplotlib` to process images, since I was asked to teach from the basics. Even tho, I programmed some image differentials (sober X and sober Y) to illustrate some image processing.
